# Online Smart Parking System (OSPS)

This project implements an **Online Smart Parking System (OSPS)**, designed to manage parking spaces efficiently and provide a user-friendly experience.

## System Features

### 1. User Management:
- User registration and authentication.
- User profile management (personal information, payment methods).

### 2. Parking Space Management:
- Define parking spaces (location, size, type, price).
- Manage parking space availability (occupied, vacant).
- Real-time updates on parking space status.

### 3. Booking Management:
- Allow users to search and book available parking spaces.
- Manage booking details (start time, end time, vehicle information).
- Handle booking cancellations and modifications.

### 4. Payment Processing:
- Integrate with payment gateways (credit card, digital wallets).
- Generate invoices and receipts.
- Handle refunds and disputes (if applicable).

### 5. Reporting and Analytics (Optional):
- Generate reports on parking utilization, revenue, and user behavior.
- Provide data-driven insights for parking management.

## System Architecture

The system uses object-oriented design principles with classes for entities like:
- **User**
- **Vehicle**
- **ParkingSlot**
- **Booking**
- **Payment**
- **Invoice**

Service classes like `UserServices`, `BookingServices`, and `InvoiceServices` encapsulate business logic for user management, booking operations, and invoice generation.

### Database
- A relational database is used to store data.
- An **Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)** can be optionally used for efficient data access.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Object-Relational Mapper (ORM):** SQLAlchemy
  
## Running the System

### 1. Install Required Dependencies
- Ensure you have [insert dependencies] installed.
- Example:  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt  # For Python-based projects
  ```

### 2. Configure Database Connection
- Modify the configuration file to include database connection details:
  ```bash
  DB_HOST=localhost
  DB_USER=root
  DB_PASSWORD=password
  ```

### 3. Run the Main Application
- Execute the main script to start the application:
  ```bash
  python main.py  # Replace with your main file name
  ```

## Further Development

1. Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
2. Integrate real-time parking sensors for automatic availability updates.
3. Develop mobile app versions (Android, iOS) for on-the-go access.
4. Implement advanced features like dynamic pricing or loyalty programs (Optional).
